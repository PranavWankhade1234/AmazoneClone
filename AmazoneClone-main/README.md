# Amazon Clone - Front Page
This is a clone of the front page of the popular e-commerce website Amazon.com. It is a static web page built using HTML and CSS to replicate the design and layout of Amazon's landing page. This project serves as a demonstration and learning exercise to showcase my web development skills.
# Getting Started
To view the Amazon Clone front page, follow these steps:

# Technologies Used

# Customization
  Feel free to customize the content, layout, and styling to match your desired preferences. You can modify the HTML code in the index.html file and the CSS     
  styles in the styles.css file. Add your own images or use placeholder images to replace the existing ones.
